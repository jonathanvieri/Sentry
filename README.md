<p>
  Sentry is a simple mock CCTV app designed to demonstrate real-time object detection using a live camera feed. Powered by Vision and Core ML frameworks, Sentry uses the lightweight YOLOv3Tiny model to detect and classify objects, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to live detection, Sentry includes functionality for playing videos from the user's library or a given URL. This project serves as a learning exercise to integrate machine learning models into iOS apps while deepening knowledge of AVFoundation, Vision, and PhotoKit frameworks.

## Features
- **Live Object Detection**: Detects and classifies objects in real time using a live camera feed, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores.
- **Video Playback**: Lets users play videos from their library or a given URL, showcasing AVFoundation's video handling capabilities.
- **Core ML Integration**: Uses the YOLOv3Tiny model for on-device object detection, balancing performance and speed.
- **Interactive Overlays**: Displays bounding boxes and labels that update dynamically during live object detection.
- **Learning-Focused**: A hands-on project to explore AVFoundation, Vision, Core ML, and PhotoKit frameworks.
