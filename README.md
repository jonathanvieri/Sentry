<p>
  Sentry is a simple mock CCTV app designed to demonstrate real-time object detection using a live camera feed. Powered by Vision and Core ML frameworks, Sentry uses the lightweight YOLOv3Tiny model to detect and classify objects, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to live detection, Sentry includes functionality for playing videos from the user's library or a given URL. This project serves as a learning exercise to integrate machine learning models into iOS apps while deepening knowledge of AVFoundation, Vision, and PhotoKit frameworks.
